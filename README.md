# 🏡 Airbnb Price Prediction

This project builds a machine learning model to predict Airbnb listing prices based on features like location, room type, number of reviews, and more. It uses exploratory data analysis and regression techniques to understand trends and estimate pricing.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- Conducted **data cleaning and preprocessing** on Airbnb listing data
- Explored correlations and feature distributions using visualizations
- Built and evaluated **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regressor** models
- Identified top features affecting price: location, room type, availability, and reviews

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Model Performance

- **R² Score**: ~0.76 with Random Forest
- **RMSE**: ~18.5
- Best results achieved after removing outliers and applying feature scaling
